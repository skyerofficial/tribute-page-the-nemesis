                Google &#8217;s announcement on Monday that it would be subsumed within a new
                parent company called Alphabet had a bonus for people of Indian-origin world
                over: the company &#8217;s head of Products and Engineering, Chennai-born Pichai
                Sundararajan, was anointed the CEO of the new, "slimmed down" Google.

               
               Mr. Pichai, who is a graduate of IIT Kharagpur and Stanford University, had
               really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and
               engineering responsibility for our Internet businesses, Mr. Page said in a blog
               post, adding that he and Mr. Brin were super excited about his progress and
               dedication to the company.<br><br>
               
               He started his career at the search giant as a product  manager overseeing its
               browser search toolbar,not an incredibly exciting product but important at the
               time since it gave users the option to make Google their default search engine 
               on Internet Explorer and Firefox.<br><br>
               
            
               After earning an MBA at Wharton (where, as at IIT and Stanford, he earned 
               top academic honors), Pichai worked at McKinsey and Company and a firm 
               called Applied Materials that provides supplies to semiconductor manufacturers. And when he moved to Google in 2004,
              Pichai distinguished himself as the architect of one of the most valuable products in Google&#8217;s
               vast repository: its ubiquitous, lightning-fast information sponge of a web browser, Chrome.

                 Mr. Pichai started at Google in 2004, where he was known as a "low-key manager" who worked on the Google toolbar and then led the launch of the market-beating Chrome browser in 2008.

Following this his rise through the ranks of Google took on an increasingly meteoric tenor, and soon he became Vice President, then Senior Vice President, and ultimately was charged with supervising all Google apps including Gmail and Google Drive and finally given control of Android itself.<br><br><br>

His promotion to Product Chief in October 2014 literally made him Mr. Page&#8217;s second-in-command with oversight of day-to-day operations for all of Google's major products including maps, search, and advertising.
           The Google founders no doubt recognised that Mr. Pichai was a man on an evangelical-type mission for pushing the boundaries of technology.<br><br><br>

Mr. Pichai most eloquently outlined this mission when he said, "For me, it matters that we drive technology as an equalising force, as an enabler for everyone around the world. Which is why I do want Google to see, push, and invest more in making sure computing is more accessible, connectivity is more accessible."
